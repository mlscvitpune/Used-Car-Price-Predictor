# Used-Car-Price-Predictor

### This is a Machine Learning Project with an aim to predict the resale values of cars using different ML algorithms.

#### This project comprises of a variety of different models that we can use to showcase how different machine learning algorithms work. Some of the models used are:
#### Linear Regression
#### Decision Tree
#### Lasso Model
#### Neural networks
 
 After evaluation, it is found that these models differ in their predictions, some will go higher than others, but they are all in the same range, differeing by a couple thousand.  
#### You can find the dataset used in the project [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pAg6WTzxVBridKjFRV2TmQoQzUPj9zhg?usp=sharing) and feel free to try and create your best model!

#### Simply run `preprocessing.ipynb` to save your preprocessing time :)

## How to setup -
1. Clone the repository on your local system
2. Install requirements.txt - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
